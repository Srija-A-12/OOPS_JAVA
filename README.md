This repository contains small projects designed to **learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in Java.  
Instead of just theory, each project focuses on implementing real-world examples using OOP principles.  

---

## üéØ Goals of This Repository
- Understand **OOP concepts** by building small, practical projects.  
- Learn how to use **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.  
- Get comfortable with writing **clean and extensible Java code**.

# üìò Learn OOP with Projects  

This repository is created to **learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in Java through small projects.  
Each project demonstrates how OOP principles are applied in real-world scenarios.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Telecommunication (DeskPhone Simulation)  

### üìå Concepts in this Project
- **Interface** ‚Üí `Telephone` defines a contract of methods (`dial`, `answer`, `powerOn`, etc.)  
- **Implementation Class** ‚Üí `DeskPhone` implements the interface and provides behavior.  
- **Encapsulation** ‚Üí Fields like `myNumber` and `isRinging` are kept private and accessed only through methods.  
- **Polymorphism** ‚Üí Any class (e.g., `MobilePhone`) can also implement the `Telephone` interface in the future.  
- **Method Overriding** ‚Üí The implementing class overrides interface methods with its own logic.  

### ‚ùì Why Interface?  
If we don‚Äôt use an interface, our design becomes rigid. For example:  
- Every new type of phone would require changes in the existing class.  
- Code reusability and flexibility would be lost.  
- Interfaces solve this by enforcing a **common structure** that all phones must follow.
