This repository contains small projects designed to **learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in Java.  
Instead of just theory, each project focuses on implementing real-world examples using OOP principles.  

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Understand **OOP concepts** by building small, practical projects.  
- Learn how to use **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.  
- Get comfortable with writing **clean and extensible Java code**.

# 📘 Learn OOP with Projects  

This repository is created to **learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in Java through small projects.  
Each project demonstrates how OOP principles are applied in real-world scenarios.

## 1️⃣ Telecommunication (DeskPhone Simulation)  

### 📌 Concepts in this Project
- **Interface** → `Telephone` defines a contract of methods (`dial`, `answer`, `powerOn`, etc.)  
- **Implementation Class** → `DeskPhone` implements the interface and provides behavior.  
- **Encapsulation** → Fields like `myNumber` and `isRinging` are kept private and accessed only through methods.  
- **Polymorphism** → Any class (e.g., `MobilePhone`) can also implement the `Telephone` interface in the future.  
- **Method Overriding** → The implementing class overrides interface methods with its own logic.  

### ❓ Why Interface?  
If we don’t use an interface, our design becomes rigid. For example:  
- Every new type of phone would require changes in the existing class.  
- Code reusability and flexibility would be lost.  
- Interfaces solve this by enforcing a **common structure** that all phones must follow.  

### ▶️ Example Output
```text
welcome back
Phone is ringing
picking the phone

✅ This project helps understand how **interfaces, encapsulation, and polymorphism** work together in Java OOP.

## 2️⃣ Banking Application
---
### 📌 Concepts in this Project

* **Encapsulation** → All fields (`accountNumber`, `balance`, `name`, `email`, `phoneNumber`) are private, accessed through getters and setters.
* **Abstraction** → User interacts with simple methods (`depositMoney`, `withdraw`, `displayAccountDetails`) without knowing the internal logic.
* **Constructor** → Initializes account details in a single step.
* **Behavior via Methods** →

  * `depositMoney(double amount)` → Add funds.
  * `withdraw(double amount)` → Withdraw if balance is sufficient.
  * `displayAccountDetails()` → Show account summary.

### ▶️ Example Output

```text
--- Account Details ---
Account Number: 123456
Account Holder: Srija
Email: srijaa@gmail.com
Phone: 1234567890
Balance: 0.0
-----------------------

✅ Deposit successful. New balance: 1234.0
✅ Deposit successful. New balance: 1246.0
✅ Withdrawal successful. New balance: 11.0
⚠️ Insufficient balance. Current balance: 11.0
```

✅ This project demonstrates **encapsulation and abstraction** in a real-world banking scenario.
* Banking → Focused on **encapsulation & abstraction**

## 3️⃣ Mobile Simulation 📱

### 📌 Concept:

* Simulates a **Mobile Phone** with actions like **taking pictures, recording videos, playing games, and charging**.
* Demonstrates **Encapsulation** (private fields with getters/setters) and **Abstraction** (hiding battery logic, exposing only actions).

### 🔑 OOP Concepts Used:

* **Encapsulation** → All attributes (`screenSize`, `companyName`, `operatingSystem`, `batteryPercent`) are private.
* **Abstraction** → User interacts with `takePicture()`, `recordVideo()`, `playGame()`, and `charge()` without worrying about internal logic.
* **Constructor** → Initializes mobile details.

### 🧾 Example:

```java
Mobile mobile = new Mobile(15, "Apple", "iOS");
mobile.takePicture();
mobile.recordVideo();
mobile.playGame();
mobile.charge();
```

**Output:**

```
📸 Picture taken successfully.
🎥 Video recorded successfully.
❌ Battery too low to play games.
⚡ Mobile fully charged (100%).
```

This way, your **main OOP README** will now have:
1️⃣ Telecommunication (Interfaces, Abstraction)
2️⃣ Banking (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
3️⃣ Mobile Simulation (Encapsulation + Abstraction)
